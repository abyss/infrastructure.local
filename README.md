# Infrastructure Code for Local Network

Infrastructure and configuration as code for my home servers. Mostly using ansible and bash. Maybe eventually using some terraform goodness.

If you find any of it useful, feel free to use it. If you have suggestions for me, feel free to reach out. [My Discord server](https://discord.abyss.dev/) might be the best route.

## Server descriptions
Chaos: Unraid server hosting many docker containers and all virtual machines.

Agora: "Linux extension" of my user environment. Things I can't do on Windows happen here (instead of WSL).

Arcadia: Server for hosting Discord bots.
